Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems in order to solve problems. It has enabled the creation of software applications that power various aspects of modern life including communication commerce banking etc. 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development methodologies, Modeling approach, Process versus products, Second Childhood, Hybrid Software Systems and Market Pressure.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning is the first phase, it is the conceptualization 
Analysis is the second phase that explains the intention of the concept 
Design is the modeling and calculation 
Coding is the use of computer language 
Testing 
Deployment 
Maintenance 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile methodologies are both methods used in software development but waterfall is one of the earliest methods of software development while Agile is one of the recent. The waterfall model laid the foundation for structured software development and provided a systematic approach for managing software projects while Agile methodology has been a game-changer in the software development world. It really helped teams become more efficient and adaptable to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developers are the builders of the software system.

They write, test, and maintain code to create software solutions based on the projectâ€™s specifications.

Software developers also collaborate with the software architect to ensure the project runs smoothly.
Quality Assurance: Multiple sets of eyes scrutinizing the software can significantly reduce the likelihood of errors and bugs.
Project managers are the glue that holds the software development team together.

They typically work with product owners, business analysts, developers, and other team members.

Overseeing the entire development process, project managers ensure that software projects are completed on time and within budget.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
The advent of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) marked a significant milestone in software engineering. IDEs provide developers with a comprehensive set of tools, including code editors, debuggers, and build automation.
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Rapid advancement of technology 
Increasing customers demands in the development stage 
Time limitation 
Limited resources 
Undefined system boundaries 
Conflicting interests 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of developing prompts that produce clear and useful responses from AI tools. AI prompting can help direct a large language model to execute tasks based on different inputs. The goal is to teach AI models to provide the best output to a query.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
